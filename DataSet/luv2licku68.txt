I looked out the window this morning and it was cold and snowy and so i told mom i had stomach cramps

lol I dunno, didnt feel much like going to school today
school bores me
lol why does it bore you? do you not just like it or are you smart that it's boring?

There are lots of kids that just goof off and stuff so the teachers pay all their attention to them
I always get good grades and stuff, its always been that way i guess, i just rembmer stuff easily, i dunno
Grammys always saying I'm 50 going on 13 lol
well that's good that you are smart
or the other way round lol
lol she might be rigth
you're 13 going on 50 :)
They do a success academy that I want to get into next year
when you graduate high school, you get an associates degree

My neighbor just went to boot camp somewhere in texas i think
a friend of mine was a Navy eal
seal
thats cool, i bet he went to some neat places?
I really want to travel some day
some yeah
probly some scary ones too
he was over in the persian gulf for the gulf war back in 91
thats a long time ago
before i was born
lol uh huh
so what you doing today?
i was going to cut up some firewood but can't cuz don't have the right chain saw blade so basically not much
why do you have to have the right blade, cant u just use any blade?
the bar for the chain saw is 18" so you need an 18" chain and a 16" one was bought
oooooohhhh ok well that doesnt mean much to me lol but i guess it screws up your wood cutting plans huh
lol uh huh :)
it would be like ummmmm
lol what would?
do you ride bike
yeah
ok so your chain on your bike
its easy to get to my friends houses
ok
lol 
if you need a chain that was only 20" long but your dad bought a chain that was 18" long it wouldn't work
oh, ok, i get it now
see, i learned something by being home sick today lol
lol you sure did sweetie
yay lol

;)
is that bad of me to maybe wanna feel that?
lolz.... i dunno, why would uthink that?
why would i think that it's bad?
yeah
well cuz younger girls aren't supposed to do that to older guys cuz the guys can get into trouble
oh
didn't you know that?
well no 
if we did something and someone found out i'd get into ALOT of trouble
but ur like my friend
i know but that doesn't matter sweetie, it's against the law
oh
but i really like talkin with u n stuff
and i like it too and i want to keep talking to you it's just the touching stuff that is wrong
i thought u said u wanted that?
i do but it's still against the law
oh, ok.... im good at keeping secrets n stuff
good :)
if you touched it and held it in your little hand, it'd get really big and hard
really? what happens then?
after it gets big and hard?
yeah
well you can either like squeeze it or just hold it or slide your hand up and down it
k... isnt there like other stuff ur supposed to do?
supposed to do?
lol, i dunno.. 
does it feel good to u?
well some girls will put their mouth over it and will lick it
it does, it feels really good
do u like when girls use their mouth?
yeah i do
:)
and like now when we're talking about this, it gets kinda tingly
for realz?
uh huh
tingly like how? like tickly?
ummm it's hard to explain but even talking about tthings will make it get hard
really?
uh huh
so i guess u really like to do stuff that like with girls..

woah.... plasma????? that like really hurts right??
not really
but dont they like stick a needle in ur bone or something?
in your vein
oh so just like giving blood rite?
yep
awwww ur real sweet. mom says its real important to donate blood n stuff. mom would be proud of you :)
well ty, they pay you to donate though
wow, but u gotta be an adult thogh?
yeah, at least 17 i think
oh ok, i was hoping to get some extra pocket money lol
i got rare blood too - do you think they'd pay more for it?
i'm not sure, they pay more for if you have like a different plasma
huh. is yours special?
i don't think so
lolz... i was teasing ya cos your special to me :)
ohhhhhhhhhh
so how was your day
ok i guess. it was like real cold again today. i hate the winter. i want it to be summer.l i don't much like winter clothes lol
i lost my gloves AGAIN. moms gonna be mad if she finds out
i think i left em on the bus but i dont remembeer wearing them when i got on, so i dunno lo
lol how did you lose them?
ohhhhhhhhh
well i loaned them to jazz yesterday i think coz she lost hers n my hands werent cold
then anyways.... they were freezing on the walk from teh bus lol
and you don't know where your gloves are :)
no lol. jazz probly has em, i'll ask her later
so how was yoru football last nite?
it was good, ended up 22-19
22 for your team right?
i didn't care who won
lol, so u must hav liked both sides?
it sounds like it was a good game coz the scores were real close togeher
all that mattered to me was that it was a close game so it was pretty good
aww thats real cool. im pleased you had fun
so did you see any fun jbs to apply for?
i saw a couple
kewl :)
our ski resort place was on the news the other day
what are you gonna do tonite
oh yeah, what for?
well it was something about the spa beautiy place they have there n some deals or something. it was on like the cbs channel i think in the morning
the one with the Casey man
oh ok
i only got 3 days of school left then i got a 3 day weekend :d
sweeeeeeeeeeeeeet
yeah i cant wait :)
i can sleep in for 3 whole mornings :) lol
if mom doesn tleave me a list of chores to do
:)
oh n i forgot to put out the trash last night and had to do it this mornign lolz

that's good :)
yeah :) mom was in a bad mood when she came home last night
awwwwww
i didnt want to make her madder lol
how are they getting along?
ok i guess. they dont much see each other. dad goes out of town in a couple days n moms working extra shifts. 
someimes i wish theyd get divorced. one of my friends parents are divorced n she gets all kinds of cool gifts from both her parents - i think they feel bad they dont live together any more
wouldn't it be better if they could get along and be happy though instead of getting a divorce?
yeah but i dont ever see that happening, they havent loved each other for years i dont think
that sucks
they been fighting as long as i cna remember
dad says mom likes working so much coz theres a dorctor at te hospital that she really likes,i dunno thogh
:(
lol, maybe mom does have a secret boyfriend, i dunno
she started wearing perfume to work a few momths back so maybe lolz
ewwwww thats a really gross thought tho - my mom has a bf - yuck! lol
idk 
uh huh
wow, that would really suck lol. my mom got a bf n i dont :( 
you're to young to have a b/f
am not! lol some of my frinds at school got them
lol that doesn't mean they're old enough, i have a 13 yr old niece and i don't think she's old enough to have one
yeah i guess, i dunno :)
would still be kinda cool tho
i spose so :)
i spose so :)
